/**
 * Write your rich extensions here they are allowed CSS classes that are for use
 * in the raw text mode, used by the CMS mostly, in order to build your interface
 * properly for the property view text, this allows some flexibility to the raw builder
 * NOTE that these classes can also be accessed by a malicious user, so be wary, don't make
 * any class with position: fixed or that allows to cover the entire screen, if you truly
 * need so make sure that they can only be executed under an id eg. #my-element .rich-text--fixed
 * and that under no circumstance an user element can be accessed that way, as ids are not allowed
 * and are sanitized, otherwise use an invalid class name for trusted content
 *
 * All classes must be prefixed by rich-text-- or they would otherwise not be allowed,
 * you can also use ids in order to ensure they are only descendants of a children
