import { initializeServer } from "@onzag/itemize/nodejs/server";

// Itemize server isn't hot, it won't refresh in realtime and it
// isn't recommended to attempt to set it up that way

// for a given build number all the resources are considered equal,
// resources are contained within the /rest/resources/ endpoint during
// development of the app remember to disable service workers by making it
// bypass for network or otherwise the content you will get will always be the
// same, this bypasses the build number functionality on the client side
// but only after reload

// some changes require a server reload as well, such as enforcing a new build number
// adding new languages, changing API keys, etc... and of course, changing server code

// itemize is heavily offline so it always attempts not to call the server, itemize
// apps are also aware of when they are not connected to the server and it doesn't make
// them crash (except in development mode with service workers off)

// when a new version of an itemize app is deployed the client can realize that
// due to a new build number that doesn't match its internal build number, which will
// trigger the refresh of all the resources and wipes the client side caches a refresh
// is requested, if the app is just being launched when that is detected, it will refresh
// immediately and load the new version, otherwise if it happens while the user uses the app
// it will mark the app as outdated and you can have custom logic for outdated apps
// outdated apps only exists for that session

// also remember to flush your redis cache if you perform any database updates
// in development this is as easy as stoping and starting the dev environment
